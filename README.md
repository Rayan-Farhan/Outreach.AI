## How It Works

The workflow is powered by a sequence of specialized agents:

### 1. Google Maps Lead Finder  
- Uses **Serper.dev API** to fetch business data (name, address, phone, website).  

### 2. Website Scraper  
- Visits the business website to extract:  
  - Raw text  
  - Email addresses  
  - Social media profiles  
  - About page content  

### 3. Company Info Extractor  
- Uses **Groq + LLaMA-3** to distill website data into:  
  - Business description  
  - Unique selling points  
  - Target audience  

### 4. Export Agent  
- Compiles all enriched leads into a clean **CSV export**.
